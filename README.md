# ELAN (Executable Language for Artificial Neurons)

**Purpose:** A minimal, recursive programming language designed to model cognition, memory, logic, and internal agency in artificial systems.

---

## What is ELAN?

ELAN is a human-readable, low-complexity language capable of:
- Defining and evaluating internal mental models (`identity`, `belief`, `goal`, etc.)
- Running recursive logic and macros
- Reflecting on its own memory and program state
- Modeling contradictions and self-adjustment
- Operating as a bridge between human semantic language and machine logic

## 🧠 Current Features ****

- ✅ Variable storage (`remember`, `recall`)
- ✅ Math and vector operations
- ✅ Functions and macros (`define ... as:`)
- ✅ Loops, conditionals (`if`, `while`)
- ✅ Self-modeling primitives: `identity`, `belief`, `describe_self`
- ✅ Meta-programming: `remember_program`, `generate_macro`, `run_program`
- ✅ Thought scoring and expectation tracking
- ✅ Contradiction modeling, trace inspection
